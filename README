wrote two variations of rpn_calculator.rb and wanted to see which was faster. 

here is the code: https://github.com/somlor/learn_ruby/blob/master/12_rpn_calculator/rpn_calculator.rb

here are the results:

                            user       system     total       real
    refactor: simple math:  0.900000   0.000000   0.900000 (  0.904070)
    original: simple math:  0.100000   0.000000   0.100000 (  0.100580)

    refactor: harder math:  2.050000   0.010000   2.060000 (  2.070785)
    original: harder math:  0.140000   0.000000   0.140000 (  0.140768)

    refactor: string eval:  4.020000   0.010000   4.030000 (  4.033575)
    original: string eval:  4.630000   0.000000   4.630000 (  4.645004)

my refactor used method_missing which i'm assuming is costly.
